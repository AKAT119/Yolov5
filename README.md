Introduction:

As part of my curiosity, I have tried to explore YoloV5 to examine its capabilities.
This project is utilizing YOLOv5 for object detection. 
The project involves preparing a dataset, training the YOLOv5 model, and performing object detection on images. Considered 4 classes to detect and categorize traffic signs on roads. Modified YOLOv5 folders and split dataset. 



Installation


To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1- Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AKAT119/Yolov5.git

2- Install PyTorch and other necessary Python packages:
pip install torch

3- Navigate to the cloned YOLOv5 directory:
pip install torch

4- Install YOLOv5 requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt



Features

Custom dataset preparation for object detection.
Training YOLOv5 model with configurable parameters.
Performing object detection on new images.
How it Works

How it works

The project prepares a dataset by organizing and splitting images and corresponding labels.
It utilizes the YOLOv5 model for training on the prepared dataset.
After training, the model can be used to detect objects in new images.
